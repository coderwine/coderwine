Greetings!

I've been teaching the fundamentals of development since 2020. This includes full stack development focused within React and Node utilizing both a PERN and MERN stack. I also taught the fundamentals of C# during this time but find that my energy is best placed within the JavaScript realm and I enjoy simply building, planning, designing, and teaching it.

I have several project ideas that I'm building out and detailing within my own GitBook that I aim to release as time permits (as I typically build outside of my full time job).

Always aiming to improve! My aim is to focus on the AWS ecosystem and dive even further into various styling libraries to help keep my UX/UI skills in practice.

As an aside, I enjoy learning and investing into real estate and working with people. I'm a guitarist (hobbyist) and avid board gamer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I own over 150 board games.
