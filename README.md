Greetings!

I am currently a web dev instructor focused mainly on the fundamentals of javascript and digging deeper into React and Nodejs.

I'm currently working on an fullstack application that will help people manage their own properties and organize their household needs.  Of course, this is along with my desire to update my portfoio in the meanwhile.

I'm will also be focusing on learning the AWS ecosystem so that I can properly utilize it for both my own needs and potentially for teaching purposes.

That's me in a quick nutshell!  I hope to include more later on.  Thanks!
